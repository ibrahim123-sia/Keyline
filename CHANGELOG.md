# Changelog

All notable changes to Propel. Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The product is renamed to **Propel** (it was first "Lintel", then "Keyline"). Names in the
  app, emails, PDFs, docs, the package, Cloudflare resources (`propel`, `propel-cache`,
  `propel-media`, `propel-jobs`, `propel-jobs-dlq`, and `-staging`), demo logins
  (`@demo.propel`) and the local data folder (`~/.propel`) follow. Sign-in, consent and
  currency cookies, browser storage keys and `KEYLINE_*` environment variables keep working
  under their old names and move to the new ones; database objects and old migrations keep
  their names.

### Performance

- The map stylesheet loads with the map, page builder forms check input without Zod in the browser, and dialogs, the phone menu and the header menus load their code the first time they open.

### Fixed

- The home page search card no longer squeezes the area field in narrow columns.
- A listing's address line names each place once ("Dubai Marina, Dubai", not "Dubai Marina, Dubai Marina, ...").
- Lighthouse accessibility 100 and SEO 100 on the home, search and listing pages on a phone.

- Blog and page rich text saved from the editor no longer fails validation ("Invalid input").
- The 404 monitor counts visits at request time instead of breaking prerendering.
- Website chat and the admin inbox no longer crash in browsers where scrolling returns a promise.
- Tour booking fits its dialog when there are many days to choose from.
- A shortlist's opens are counted once per visit in a browser (not twice, and not by link previews).

### Changed

- Documentation moved to `docs/` (specification in `docs/spec/`, build progress in `docs/PROGRESS.md`); new README, contributing guide, security policy, pull request template and licence.
